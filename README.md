# Goal
This is a priority queue implementation built on a list structure. The main.c mimics a shopping scenerio where each customer goes through
four phases: arrive -> waiting for cashier -> checking out -> leaving. The customer as events are created using a normal distribution (randsim.c)

# Implementation
Compile each file according to its header file. When running, the program will prompts for necessary parameter.
